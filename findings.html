                    In this section, we'll tell you about our findings based on data from the New York Taxi dataset. 
                    A comprehensive analysis of this data provides insights into the workings of the New York City taxi industry and the behaviour of its customers.

                    Let's start by looking at the distribution of passenger payments to drivers across the various dimensions!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image" id="image1">
                <img src="./frontend/resources/images/fare_distribution.png" alt="fare distribution"/>
                <p class="caption">This figure shows the distribution of taxi trip fares in the $0 to $100 range, revealing that the majority of trips are relatively cheap.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="para" id="para4">
                <p>
                    From the above figure we can see that the distribution of fares shows a clear right skewed pattern, 
                    indicating that most of the journeys have relatively low fares. 
                    And this pattern is common in the taxi industry as most passengers tend to use taxis to complete short journeys.
                    Based on the peak data in the histogram, we can surmise that this is the distance from the centre of New York City to the surrounding area, 
                    as this is the most common travel distance in the city.
                    Although the maximum value of the fare is set to $100 in this figure, there are in fact many outliers, such as fares in excess of $200. 
                    But these outliers are small in number, perhaps reflecting the cost of longer trips or peak times.
                    In addition to this, the KDE curve provides a smoothed view of the fare distribution, further confirming the observation that the majority of journeys have lower fares. 
                    The curve peaks at lower fares and then gradually declines, indicating that the number of trips with lower fares is much higher than the number of trips with higher fares.

                <p class="caption">This boxplot visualises the distribution of taxi journey costs by hour of the day, revealing fluctuations and outliers at different times of the day.</p>

                <p>
                    From the above figure we can see that the median fluctuates between time periods, 
                    which means that the mainstream travelling distances are different or the traffic conditions are variable at different times of the day. 
                    The outliers in the box plot mean that there are journeys that are longer than normal or that traffic conditions are poor at that time of day. 
                    In addition to this, the 5am box has the longest length, meaning that costs fluctuate more at this time of day. 
                    Shorter boxes mean that the costs are more similar for that time of day.

                    The chart above shows how the average fare changes over the course of a day. 
                    We can notice a significant rise in fares at 5am again, which could be due to an increase in costs due to a reduction in supply.

                    Combining the three figures, we can find some discoveries about the fare:

                    1. Most New York taxi fares are relatively low amounts because short journeys are more common in the city.

                <p>
                    2. Taxi fares are higher in the early morning hours, mainly due to the imbalance between supply and demand caused by fewer taxi drivers.

                    The above findings can help taxi operating companies to better plan the operating hours of taxis as well as the number of taxis to be operated, 
                    and at the same time help passengers to plan their travelling time wisely. More importantly, 
                    it can help city administrators to arrange the public transport in the city in a more rational way, 
                    and to reduce the tailpipe emission in order to reduce the heat island effect and air pollution in the city.
